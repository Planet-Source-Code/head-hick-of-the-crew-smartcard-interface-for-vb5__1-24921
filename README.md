## Smartcard Interface for VB5\+


</div>

### Description

This code will demonstrate the windows API for communicating with a smartcard. This source/program was specifically designed to read the non-volatile information on DSS digital TV access cards of the older P2 H series type. Note that this program does NOTHING illegal, its only a tool for educating yourself in the field of smartcard technology. This program does nothing to a card other than read information thats on it. It "can" be made to write to a smartcard rather easily :-)
 
### More Info
 
You DO need to have a ISO7816 smartcard reader/writer in order to evaluate this software.
